# CaptureScript

![image](Readme/image.png)
The CaptureScript is a custom two part script created for this engagement to capture performance metrics on an Android device in a repeatable manner across several APKs.

### Requirement

- [ADPF](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.adaptiveperformance@5.1/manual/index.html) package to capture
  thermal data if needed.
- Bash compatible console to run bash script.

### Quick Start

#### Setup

- Add CaptureScript MonoBehaviour to a new or existent GameObject
- Have another script to call `public static void OnPassWaypoint()` of the CaptureScript

#### How it works

When the `OnPassWaypoint()` method is called on the Capture Script object, it records a snapshot of performance metrics at that moment. These metrics are then logged in a CSV file. This capturing and logging process repeats until a helper bash script terminates the capture and transfers the CSV file to a designated results folder.

#### Helper bash script

The bash script is designed to automate the process of running multiple Android Packages (APKs) on a connected Android device and fulfills four key objectives:
1. Installs and runs APKs on the connected device
2. Stops the APK from running after a set amount of time
3. Copies the generated CSV of metrics data from the device back to the connected computer
4. If there are more APKs to test, the script monitors the deviceâ€™s temperature until it reaches a specified threshold before installing and running the next APK

| Settings                      |                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minimum Time Between Captures | Set a delay after taking a capture before taking another one.                                                       |
| Screen Capture Cadence        | In debug builds, screenshots will be captured when this many stat captures have occurred. Set to 0 to disable. one. |
| Fps Sample Count              | Set the size of the sample when gathering metrics, larger value will give more stable values.                       |
